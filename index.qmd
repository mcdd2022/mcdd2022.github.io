Hi! I'm Mayra. I'm from Istanbul, Turkey and I'm a junior at Pomona College, majoring in Cognitive Science, thinking of concentrating in Human-Centered Design and minoring in Data Science. I love creating things (painting, collaging, etc.), travelling, and spending quality time with my family and friends, including my dog!
